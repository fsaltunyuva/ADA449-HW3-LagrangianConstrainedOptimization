## Homework 3 - Constrained Optimization (with equality and inequality) using Lagrangian Method

In this homework, we will do little constrained optimization to approximate the local minima of some function Throughout, we will be assuming that you are dealing with inequality constraints. To do this you will use the Lagrange method. You should keep in mind that penalization parameters λ and μ are to be chosen by you.

Here is your optimization problem: 

Minimize f(x,y) = (x^2 + y -11)^2 + (x+ y^2 - 7)^2 subject to norm([x,y]) <= 3.70 and x+y = 0.
